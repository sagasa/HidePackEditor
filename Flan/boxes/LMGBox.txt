//AddAmmo must come immediately after AddGun for them to be in the same slot
//The names of the items / blocks are those in the code, with some exceptions such as iron _ingotIron_ and gunpowder _sulphur_
//And with parts from this mod, they are the shortName of the item
//Guns cannot yet have multiple ammo types in the same slot. For now, just list them under two seperate guns that are the same
